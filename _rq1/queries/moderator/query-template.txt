Given two Java assertions, determine if they are semantically equivalent.
Do not consider escape characters for your judgement. Put your answer between: <keep></keep>.
Reply only in one of these two forms <keep>EQUIVALENT</keep> or <keep>NOT EQUIVALENT</keep>.
The content of the answer must be less than 200 characters.
Do not show me the reasoning behind your answer, but only the answer in the mentioned format.

For example:

assertEqual("99", variable); and assertEquals("99", variable); are EQUIVALENT
assertEqual("99", variable); and assertEquals("100", variable); are NOT EQUIVALENT
assertEqual("99", variable); and assertEquals("\\\"99\\\"", variable); are EQUIVALENT
assertEqual("99", variable); and assertEquals("99 ", variable); are NOT EQUIVALENT

Query:
<TARGET> and <PREDICTION>
